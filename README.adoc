This guide walks you through the process of routing and filtering requests to a
microservice application by using the Netflix Zuul edge service library.

== What You Will Build

You will write a simple microservice application and then build a reverse proxy
application that uses https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix[Netflix Zuul]
to forward requests to the service application. You will also see how to use Zuul to
filter requests that are made through the proxy service.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

For all Spring applications, you should start with the https://start.spring.io[Spring
Initializr]. The Initializr offers a fast way to pull in all the dependencies you need for
an application and does a lot of the set up for you.

This guide needs two applications. The first application (the book application) needs only
the Spring Web dependency.

The second application (the routing and filtering application) needs the Spring Web and
Zuul dependencies.

NOTE: For convenience, we have provided build files (a `pom.xml` file and a `build.gradle`
file) at the top of the project (one directory above the `book` and `gateway` directories)
that you can use to build both projects at once. We also added the Maven and Gradle
wrappers there.

To initialize the project, create two applications:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring Web* for the book application and *Spring Web* and *Zuul* for the routing and filtering application.
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

NOTE: You can also fork the project from Github and open it in your IDE or other editor.

== Set up a Microservice

The Book service will be as simple as a Spring application can be. Edit
`RoutingAndFilteringBookApplicationBookApplication.java` so that it matches the following
listing (from
`book/src/main/java/com/example/routingandfilteringbook/RoutingAndFilteringBookApplication.java`):

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/book/src/main/java/com/example/routingandfilteringbook/RoutingAndFilteringBookApplication.java[]
----
====

The `RoutingAndFilteringBookApplicationBookApplication` class is now a REST controller.
The `@RestController` annotation marks the class as a controller class and ensures that
return values from `@RequestMapping` methods in this class are automatically and
appropriately converted and written directly to the HTTP response.

Speaking of `@RequestMapping` methods, we have added two: `available()` and
`checkedOut()`. They handle requests to the `/available` and `/checked-out` paths, each of
which returns the `String` name of a book.

Set the application name (`book`) in `src/main/resources/application.properties`, as the
following listing shows:

====
[source,properties]
----
include::complete/book/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----
====

Set `server.port` here, too, so that it does not conflict with your edge service when you
get both services up and running locally.

== Create an Edge Service

Spring Cloud Netflix includes an embedded Zuul proxy, which you can enable with the
`@EnableZuulProxy` annotation. This will turn the Gateway application into a reverse proxy
that forwards relevant calls to other services -- such as our book application.

Open the Gateway application's `RoutingAndFilteringGatewayApplicationGatewayApplication`
class and add the `@EnableZuulProxy` annotation, as the following listing (from
`gateway/src/main/java/com/example/routingandfilteringgateway/RoutingAndFilteringGatewayApplication.java`)
shows:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gateway/src/main/java/com/example/routingandfilteringgateway/RoutingAndFilteringGatewayApplication.java[]
----
====

To forward requests from the Gateway application, you need to tell Zuul the routes that it
should watch and the services to which to forward requests that are made to those routes.
We specify routes by setting properties under `zuul.routes`. Each of our microservices can
have an entry under `zuul.routes.NAME`, where `NAME` is the application name (as stored in
the `spring.application.name` property).

Add the `application.properties` file to a new directory (`src/main/resources`) in the
Gateway application. It should match the following listing (from
`gateway/src/main/resources/application.properties`):

====
[source,properties]
----
include::complete/gateway/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----
====

Spring Cloud Zuul automatically sets the path to the application name. In this sample, set
`zuul.routes.books.url` so that Zuul will proxy requests to `/books` to this URL.

Notice the second property in the `application.properties` file, Spring Cloud Netflix Zuul
uses Netflix's Ribbon to perform client-side load balancing. By default, Ribbon would use
Netflix Eureka for service discovery. For this simple example, you can skip service
discovery, so set `ribbon.eureka.enabled` to `false`. Since Ribbon now cannot use Eureka
to look up services, we must specify a `url` for the book service.

== Add a Filter

Now you can see how to filter requests through your proxy service. Zuul has four standard
filter types:

* `pre` filters run before the request is routed.
* `route` filters can handle the actual routing of the request.
* `post` filters run after the request has been routed.
* `error` filters run if an error occurs in the course of handling the request.

You are going to write a `pre` filter. Spring Cloud Netflix picks up, as a filter, any
`@Bean` that extends `com.netflix.zuul.ZuulFilter` and is available in the application
context. The following listing (from
`gateway/src/main/java/com/example/routingandfilteringgateway/filters/pre/SimpleFilter.java`)
shows the filter you need:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gateway/src/main/java/com/example/routingandfilteringgateway/filters/pre/SimpleFilter.java[]
----
====

Filter classes implement four methods:

* `filterType()`: Returns a `String` that stands for the type of the filter -- in this
case, `pre`. (It would be `route` for a routing filter.)
* `filterOrder()`: Gives the order in which this filter is to be run, relative to other
filters.
* `shouldFilter()`: Contains the logic that determines when to run this filter (this
  particular filter is always run).
* `run()`: Contains the functionality of the filter.

Zuul filters store request and state information in (and share it by means of) the
`RequestContext`. You can use that to get at the `HttpServletRequest` and then log the
HTTP method and URL of the request before it is sent on its way.

The `GatewayApplication` class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which includes
(among others) the `@Configuration` annotation that tells Spring to look in a given class
for `@Bean` definitions. Put the filter in the application class, as shown in the
following listing (from
`gateway/src/main/java/com/example/routingandfilteringgateway/RoutingAndFilteringGatewayApplication.java`):

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gateway/src/main/java/com/example/routingandfilteringgateway/RoutingAndFilteringGatewayApplication.java[]
----

== Testing Your Application

Make sure that both applications are running. In a browser, visit one of the book
application's endpoints through the Gateway application. If you have used the
configuration shown in this guide, you can access the book application directly at
`localhost:8090/available` and through the Gateway service at
`localhost:8080/books/available`.

Visit one of the Book service endpoints (`localhost:8080/books/available` or
`localhost:8080/books/checked-out`) and you should see your request's method logged by the
Gateway application before it is handed on to the Book application, as the following
sample logging output shows:

====
[source,text]
----
2019-10-02 10:58:34.694  INFO 11608 --- [nio-8080-exec-4] c.e.r.filters.pre.SimpleFilter           : GET request to http://localhost:8080/books/available
----
====

== Summary

Congratulations! You have used Spring to develop an edge service application that can
proxy and filter requests for your microservices.
